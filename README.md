# Steam-GamePlayer-Insight

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This project focuses on three main objectives:

1. **🧑‍💻 Player Insight**  
   Understand what kinds of players exist (e.g. achievers, explorers, casuals) by analyzing game ownership, playtime, and achievement profiles.

2. **🏆 Achievement Prediction**  
   Given a user’s gameplay history, can we predict which achievements they’re likely to unlock next?

3. **📈 Retention Modeling**  
   Estimate which factors contribute to whether a player continues playing a game or churns early.

## Why Analyze Player Behavior?

Steam games offer a rich ecosystem for behavioral analytics. From playtime and session patterns to achievement progression, each signal helps us understand:

- Which types of players unlock certain achievements  
- How player behaviors cluster into gameplay archetypes  
- What early in-game milestones predict long-term retention  
- How game design choices influence engagement and difficulty

This ETL system is designed to provide the clean, reliable datasets that downstream analysis depends on.
